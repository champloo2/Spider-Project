# Spider-Project

The purpose of this project is to learn how to code in Java, and also learn how to use github.

This project will be written in Java and used to track when I feed the spiders.  Each time I feed a spider, I will call a method which will ask the user which spider I want to feed, and read the input.  The input must be a positive integer to greater than the number of spiders that I have.  If a input is valid, the program will ask the user how many crickets are being fed to the spider.  The method will store the date and also add the number of crickets to the total number of crickets.

Once I have the method to feed the spider completed, I will include another method to update the molt status.  The three molt statuses will be pre-molt, post-molt, and normal.
